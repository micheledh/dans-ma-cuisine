# What is "Dans ma cuisine"?

## A recipes website

As you guessed, it's a website where you can find recipes. There are recipes of different kind: starters, mains, desserts, drinks, sauces... For each recipe, you'll find how much time it takes to make it, which ingredients you need, and of course how you do it.

## Features

### Already in place

- carousel: if you click on it, it will take you to the recipe page.
- footer: if you click on the recipes, it will take you to the recipe page. It shows my favourites recipes at the moment.
- back: on a recipe page, you can go back to the page you were before. For now, you can only go back to the home page.
- header: if you click on the website name or the logo, you'll go to the home page.
- translation: when you click on one of the language buttons in the top right corner, you'll have the website translated.

### To come

- research: you'll be able to search for a recipe by ingredient, name or keyword.
- categories: the recipes will be sorted by category.
- menu: on the left, the menu will display the categories, search inputs and language buttons.
- responsive: the actual design will be adapted for smaller screens than desktop (tablet, phone).
- design: all the design details will be improved (colors, shapes...).


# Why I'm doing it?

## To train and show my skills

I have the opportunity to code with an experienced developer, so I can keep learning and training. It is also a good exercice to create a lot of different features and show my skills to friends and potential employers.

## For personal use

After a while, I hope I'll have time to put in this website all the recipes I have, so I'll be able to search for them in one place.
